        <h3> Water Resource</h3>
        <p> Water- a must for all life forms on earth and the most important natural resource. We all know that about three-fourths of the earth’s surface is covered with water. But about 96.5% of the global water resources come from the oceans and seas. In India, the water resources amount to an estimated 1897 square kilometer per annum. However, we all know about the shortage of Water we are facing as a country. Let us learn more about the conversation of the water resource.

            <h3>Surface water </h3>
            <p> Surface water is water in a river, lake or fresh water wetland. Surface water is naturally replenished by precipitation and naturally lost through discharge to the oceans, evaporation, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. The only natural input to any surface water system is precipitation within its watershed. The total quantity of water in that system at any given time is also dependent on many other factors. These factors include storage capacity in lakes, wetlands and artificial reservoirs, the permeability of the soil beneath these storage bodies, the runoff characteristics of the land in the watershed, 
                the timing of the precipitation and local evaporation rates. All of these factors also affect the proportions of water loss.

            <h3> Groundwater </h3>
            <p>Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth's surface in rock and soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. About 30 percent of all readily available freshwater in the world is groundwater.A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil por
                e spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from the surface; it may discharge from the surface naturally at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells
                . The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.

            <h3>Importance of Water in Industries </h3>
            <p> Many industries require large quantities of water for processing, cooling, and diluting products. Examples of industries that consume large quantities of water include the paper industry, the food industry, and the chemical industry.
                Water is also used as an industrial solvent for the production of several commercially important products. Almost all power plants that generate electricity employ water to spin turbines.
                Heavy water, an important form of water, is widely used in nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator.

            <h3> Importance of Water in Human Beings </h3>
            <p>Insufficient water content in the human body results in severe dehydration, which is often accompanied by kidney failure, seizures, and swelling in the brain.
                Water helps improve the circulation of oxygen throughout the body.
                It also plays a crucial role in the digestion of food.
                Water is a very important component of saliva, which helps break down food.
                The excretion of waste in the human body requires water. Insufficient water levels in the body may increase the strain on the kidneys, resulting in the formation of kidney stones.

        <h3>Water Scarcity </h3>
        <p> Water scarcity, insufficient freshwater resources to meet the human and environmental demands of a given area. Water scarcity is inextricably linked to human rights, and sufficient access to safe drinking water is a priority for global development. However, given the challenges of population growth, profligate use, growing pollution, and changes in weather patterns due to global warming, many countries and major cities worldwide, both wealthy and poor, faced increasing water scarcity in the 21st century.

        <h3>Droughts</h3>
        <p>Drought is an extended period of unusually dry weather when there is not enough rain. The lack of precipitation can cause a variety of problems for local communities, including damage to crops and a shortage of drinking water. These effects can lead to devastating economic and social disasters, such as famine, forced migration away from drought-stricken areas, and conflict over remaining resources.

            Because the full effects of a drought can develop slowly over time, impacts can be underestimated. However, drought can have drastic and long-term effects on vegetation, animals, and people. Since 1900, more than 11 million people have died and more than 2 billion people have been affected by drought. Drought is also one of the costliest weather-related disasters. Since 2014 California has lost at least 2 billion-dollars a year, due to drought.

        <h3>Climate Change</h3>
        <p> Both seasonal and annual mean precipitation and evaporation influence patterns of water availability impacting society and ecosystems. Existing global climate studies rarely consider such patterns from non-parametric statistical standpoint. Here, we employ a non-parametric analysis framework to analyze seasonal hydroclimatic regimes by classifying global land regions into nine regimes using late 20th century precipitation means and seasonality. These regimes are used to assess implications for water availability due to concomitant changes in mean and seasonal precipitation and evaporation changes using CMIP5 model future climate projections. Out of 9 regimes, 4 show increased precipitation variation, while 5 show decreased evaporation variation coupled with increasing mean precipitation and evaporation. Increases in projected seasonal precipitation variation in already highly variable precipitation regimes gives rise to a pattern of “seasonally variable regimes becoming more variable”. Regimes with low seasonality in precipitation, instead, experience increased wet season precipitation.

        <h3> 
            Aging Infrastructure </h3>
        <p>As urban centers and communities continue to expand, the demand for reliable water infrastructure becomes increasingly vital. However, many regions around the world are grappling with aging water systems, presenting a significant challenge to water availability and quality.

            The Challenge of Aging Infrastructure
            
            Aging water infrastructure encompasses a network of pipelines, treatment facilities, and distribution systems that have surpassed their intended lifespan. These systems are susceptible to deterioration, leaks, and inefficiencies, leading to water loss and potential contamination. As a result, communities are faced with the pressing need to address these issues to ensure sustainable access to clean and safe water.
            
            Impact on Water Availability
            
            The impact of aging infrastructure on water availability is multifaceted. Leaks and pipe breaks can result in significant water loss, straining available resources and affecting the reliability of supply. Moreover, outdated treatment facilities may struggle to meet evolving water quality standards, posing risks to public health and the environment.
